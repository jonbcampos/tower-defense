/**
 * Service worker: makes the installed game launch instantly and work offline.
 *
 * Two strategies, because navigations and assets want opposite things:
 *
 *  - Navigations are network-first with a cached fallback. index.html is the
 *    one file whose name never changes, so trusting the cache for it would
 *    pin you to an old build forever.
 *  - Everything else is stale-while-revalidate: serve from cache immediately
 *    (so a launch costs no network), and refresh the entry in the background.
 *    Safe because Vite content-hashes asset filenames — a changed file is a
 *    different URL, so a stale entry can never be the *wrong* content.
 *
 * Offline works from the second launch onward: the first visit populates the
 * cache. Since installing to the home screen requires visiting first, by the
 * time the icon exists the game is already fully cached.
 */

/**
 * Bump this to force every installed copy to throw its cache away.
 *
 * `activate` deletes every cache whose name isn't the current one, so changing
 * the version is the only lever that reaches a phone with the game already on
 * its home screen. Worth doing after anything that could have been cached
 * wrong — v2 is here because GitHub Pages 404'd for most of a day during an
 * Actions outage, and any worker that installed in that window cached the
 * failures.
