/**
 * Generated art, layered over the hand-drawn painters.
 *
 * The whole module is optional. If `public/sprites/index.json` is missing —
 * because nobody has run `scripts/generate-art.mjs`, or the run failed, or half
 * of it failed — `sprite()` returns null for everything and every painter falls
 * back to the shapes it always drew. That is not a graceful-degradation nicety,
 * it is the design: the game shipped playable without any of this, the fairness
 * trials know nothing about it, and a bad art run must never be able to break a
 * working game.
 *
 * Loading is fire-and-forget at startup. Nothing waits for it; sprites simply
 * start appearing as they arrive, which on a warm cache is within a frame or
 * two and on a cold one is a second of hand-drawn art nobody will notice.
 *
 * ## Backgrounds
 *
 * The prompts ask for a flat green background rather than transparency,
 * because image models are far more reliable at "paint the background one flat
 * colour" than at producing an alpha channel. Removing it happens here, on a
 * canvas, once per image.
 *
 * The removal is a FLOOD FILL from the edges, not "delete every green pixel".
 * The difference matters: a flood fill only removes background that is actually
 * connected to the border, so a green highlight inside the slime survives while
 * the green around it goes. It also keys on the colour it finds in the corners
 * rather than on a hard-coded green, so a model that ignores the instruction
 * and gives you a flat white background still works.

 * slightly different places in their cells. Played back naively that is a

 * than the single still it replaced. No amount of prompting fixes it, because
 * it is not a drawing mistake; it is the model having no reason to care about

 *
 * So each frame is measured and moved:
 *
 *  - **Trimmed** to the box that actually contains pixels, so cell padding
 *    stops mattering.
 *  - **Scaled** most of the way towards the median frame height, so one frame
 *    drawn larger stops popping — but only most of the way, see the constant.
 *  - **Planted** on a shared floor line, so the feet stay put and the body's
 *    rise and fall is the only vertical movement left.
 *
 * Frames come back the size of one source cell, with the subject placed inside
 * exactly as a still sprite is placed inside its own square. That is deliberate:
 * it means `drawSprite` treats a frame and a still identically, and swapping
