/**
 * Does the generated art match the grid the slicer is going to cut it into?
 *
 * This exists because three sprite sheets shipped wrong and nothing noticed.
 * The manifest asked the model for a 4x2 grid; it drew the crawler as 4x4 and
 * the sock slider as 4x3, and it drew the balloon as 4x2 when the manifest had
 * asked for 4x1. In every case `sliceSheet` dutifully cut the grid it was TOLD
 * about, so each frame contained two children stacked on top of each other,
 * squeezed into a box sized for one. Reported from play as "the balloon girl is
 * small (and doubled)", weeks after it went out.
 *
 * Nothing in either checking tier could have caught it. The design contracts are
 * arithmetic over config and the trials drive the simulation — neither has any
 * idea what a picture looks like, and that is correct: the game is playable with
 * no generated art at all. So this is a third, separate check, run by hand
 * after an art run rather than on every page load:
 *
 *     __game.checkArt()
 *
 * ## How it decides
 *
 * It counts BANDS of content down the image: rows of pixels that are not
 * chroma-key green, separated by rows that are. On a correct sheet that count
 * equals the number of rows in the grid, because the prompt demands a clear
 * band of background around every figure.
 *
 * Columns are deliberately not checked. Figures reach sideways — an arm, a
 * pulled toy — and neighbouring cells overlap far too often for a band count
 * across to mean anything. Rows are reliable precisely because feet and heads
 * do not.
 *
 * A character whose art has a genuine horizontal gap inside it reads high: the
 * Balloon Kid scans as four or five bands on a two-row sheet, because the
 * balloon, the string and the child are separated by background. Those sheets
 * are named in `DETACHED` and only have to clear a floor.
 *
 * Everything else must match EXACTLY. The first version of this allowed
 * anything under twice the row count, on the theory that a stray band was
 * probably a gap — and it let the sock slider straight through at three bands
 * on a two-row grid, which is precisely the fault being looked for. A checker
 * with a tolerance wide enough to cover the bug it was written for is worse
 * than none, because it certifies the thing it missed.
 */

/**
 * Sheets whose character is drawn in pieces separated by background, so one row
 * legitimately scans as more than one band. Add to this only after LOOKING at
 * the image and confirming the grid is right.
