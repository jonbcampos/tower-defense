/**
 * Resample the generated art down to the size the game actually draws it at.
 *
 *   npm run art:shrink            # everything oversized
 *   npm run art:shrink -- --dry-run
 *
 * The image API returns generously large pictures — a 2752x1536 background, a
 * 1024x1024 walk sheet — and the game draws a kid about thirty pixels tall. The
 * excess is pure download: it costs a phone on a slow connection real seconds
 * and buys a detail nobody can see. Before this script the set was about 14 MB.
 *
 * ## Why a separate script rather than generating smaller
 *
 * Downscaling a large picture keeps more detail than asking the model for a
 * small one, because it is a resample of a finished drawing rather than a
 * coarser drawing. It is also free and repeatable, where regenerating is billed
 * and comes back as different art. So: generate big once, shrink to taste, and
 * re-shrink whenever the targets below change.
 *
 * ## Why sips
 *
 * It ships with macOS, so this stays consistent with the project's no-runtime-
 * dependency rule — nothing is added to package.json and nothing is installed.
 * The cost is that this script is macOS-only, which is acceptable for a tool
 * that is run by hand every few weeks and whose output is committed. On another
 * platform, do the same thing with ImageMagick and commit the result.
 *
 * ## This overwrites the originals
 *
 * Deliberately, because the originals are what get committed and served. The
 * full-size versions stay in git history if a target here ever turns out to be
 * too aggressive; recovering one is `git show <rev>:public/sprites/room.jpg`.
 * Running twice is harmless — anything already at or under its target is
 * skipped, so this is idempotent.
